# Cardiovascular Health Classifier ü´Ä

This project is a **machine learning model** that predicts an individual's cardiovascular health risk based on various health-related and demographic features. The model was developed using the **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to assist in early detection of cardiovascular health risks using readily available health indicators. This predictive model serves as a decision support tool in healthcare and wellness applications, deployed as a Streamlit web app for ease of use by nursing staff and clinicians.

> **üîî Notice:** This model and application are open for improvement. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are highly encouraged to enhance accuracy, usability, and overall performance. This is an ongoing project intended for educational and experimental purposes.
